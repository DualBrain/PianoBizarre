# PianoBizarre

This is a work in progress and a personal experiment in trying to create a simple synthesizer in VB.NET

So far, the library supports:
- Unlimited polyphony
- Multiple and configurable oscillator modes (Sinusoidal, Pulse, Triangular, Sawtooth, Custom Formulas, etc...)
- Supports Envelopes (Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release)
- Supports triggering multiple tone/signal generators at once (SignalMixer)

Note that for audio playback, it requires [SlimDX](https://slimdx.org/).
